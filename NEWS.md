# Release notes

## 1.1.0

Enhancements:

* The scene now looks duller under a bad weather condition. (#6)
* Added waves for water and leaves, but not plants due to a limitation
  in the current rendering system. (#10, #11)
* Replaced clouds with non-blocky, shader-generated one. Note that
  clouds will stutter after 10 minutes or so due to a vanilla bug
  losing precision of the uniform TIME.

## 1.0

The first release.
